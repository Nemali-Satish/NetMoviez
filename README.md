## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nemali-satish/netmoviez.git

### Configuration

To fetch data from the TMDb API, you need to set up an environment variable for your API key.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add the following environment variable:

   ```
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_tmdb_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key. You can get the key by signing up at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

### Running the Application
